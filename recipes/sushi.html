    <h3>Cucumber and avocado sushi</h3>
        <p>These rolls are easy to make and you can add either fake crab or smoked salmon.</p> 
        <p>Serve with teriyaki or soy sauce and wasabi!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>    
        <ul>
            <li>1 Â¼ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4 sheets of nori (dry seaweed)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cucumber, sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol type="I">
            <li><p>Combine the water and rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until</p> 
                <p>is tender and water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar and a pinch of salt. Set aside to cool.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap to keep the rice from sticking. Place a sheet of seaweed over the plastic.</p>
                <p>Use your hands to spread the rice evenly onto the sheet, leaving about 1/2 inch of seaweed empty at the bottom. </p>
                <p>Arrange strips of cucumber and avocado across the center of the rice. Lift the mat and roll over the vegetables once and press down.</p>
                <p>Unroll, then roll again towards the exposed end of the seaweed sheet to make a long roll. You may moisten with a little water to help seal.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use a sharp wet knife to slice the rolls into 5 or 6 slices. Serve cut side up with your favorite sushi condiments.</p></li>
        </ol>
